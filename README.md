# Churn Prediction Model with Random Forest Algorithm and Linear Regression

### Overview:
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as losing customers directly impacts revenue and profitability. The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that accurately identifies customers at risk of churning. By anticipating customer attrition, businesses can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers, reduce churn rates, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Results
- Random Forest Algorithm performs better than Linear Regression Model with an 86% accuracy in predicting customer churn.
- Key Insight: The Age attribute had the highest feature importance, indicating that younger customers were more likely to churn.
